# arch linux example

Arch has its own `docker` package. A 3rd party build if you will. Arch does a good job keeping up with upstream releases and doesn't tend to modify anything unnecessarily so it can be useful for learning how to install docker. Plus it is fast and uses systemd and that carries over then to other distros because most use systemd these days. 
 
- [docker package](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/docker/)
- [arch wiki about Docker](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Docker) - fantastic resource that's even applicable to other distros
- [dockerd config file docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file)
- [arch docs - systemd units](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd#Using_units) - wonderful guide, again likely applicable across distros
